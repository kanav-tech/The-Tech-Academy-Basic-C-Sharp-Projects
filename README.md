# The Tech Academy Basic C# Projects

This repository contains all of my projects and exercises completed as part of **The Tech Academy’s Basic C# course**.  
It serves as a record of my progress as I learn the fundamentals of C# programming, including topics such as variables, data types, control structures, object-oriented programming, and debugging.

Each project in this repository reflects key concepts from the coursework and demonstrates how I’ve applied them in practice.  
The repository will be updated regularly as I advance through the course and complete additional assignments.
